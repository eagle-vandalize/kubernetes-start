prometheus:
        It collects and stores information (called metrics) like:
        CPU usage of a server.
        Number of HTTP requests received by a website.
        Memory usage of an application.
        Alerting:
            If CPU usage crosses a threshold, Prometheus sends an alert (via email, Slack, etc.).
Grafana : 
        Think of Grafana as a dashboard for displaying data visually.
        It creates graphs, charts, and dashboards for easy visualization.
        You can look at a real-time dashboard showing:
            CPU usage.
            Website traffic.
            Application performance.
